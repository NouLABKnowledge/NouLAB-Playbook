# Getting a baseline

Setting a starting point or baseline is needed to track change through the workshop experience. 

Questions like: 

* What are the pain points in the issue now?
* How would you rate your level of comfort with this issue?
* Do you have knowledge or experience with this tool/way of working?
* What do you want to achieve in this workshop?
