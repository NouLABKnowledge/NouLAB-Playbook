# Team Check-outs

## Group check-out

**Purpose:** Have teams share how they are feeling about a process in order to uncover any assumptions, move towards creating a shared vision, get people on the same page, or set them up for another day of work.

**Materials:** Space for teams to gather in groups. The check-out question written on a piece of flip-chart paper.

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Step one:** Invite participants to gather into their teams. Give them a check-out question. It could be along the lines of

What was an “aha” moment from today/this workshop? What have you learned about yourself? Your team? What do you need in order to work well tomorrow?

**Step two:** If harvesting, have participants share back insights or patterns they see \(on post-its\), or even create a newspaper headline from the team’s insights. This could be captured on the mural if useful.
