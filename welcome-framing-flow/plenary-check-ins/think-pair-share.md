# Think, Pair, Share

**Purpose:** Think, Pair, Share can be a good alternative to doing a full plenary check-in as it usually happens a little quicker, and it includes different ways of processing.

**Step one:** Either in a large circle or at tables, give participants a ‘check-in question’ - see above for some examples - and then give them a few minutes to think it over for themselves \(if at tables, they could journal too\).

**Step two:** After a few minutes have them find a partner and share their responses with one another.

**Step three:** Finally, have the pairs share back to the rest of the group - you could have them share their answer to the question, share their partner’s answer, or share some patterns or insights they noticed from sharing with each other.
