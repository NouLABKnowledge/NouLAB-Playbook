We are publishing the Playbook as a [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/), an offshoot Github, the platform that powers the Open Source movement. As an Open Source ebook, anyone can add to it, or use it to build other Open Source resources. This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

To suggest changes to the Playbook, click the \[Edit on GitHub\] button on the top right of the screen and propose changes and additions to the handbook for us to approve. For those of you who haven't used GitHub before, [here's a handy guide Enspiral created for people to contribute to their GitBook](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/contributing.html). If you've got something to add to the Playbook but this process doesn't work for you, email your suggestions to [innovate@noulab.org](mailto:innovate@noulab.org). Same goes if you try any of these processes and they had good or bad outcomes we would love to hear!

This Gitbook is not a [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). However, the [five pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars) and [10 simple rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ten_Simple_Rules_for_Editing_Wikipedia) of Wikipedia provide a useful guide for the editorial standards we are aiming for to provide a reliable, neutral and accessible reference.
